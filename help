Hi!

Welcome to this game, where we use cannon balls to aim at targets and collect points! But there is a catch, you will need to collect these coins beyond a solid brick wall.. and also watch out for bad coins that give you negative points!

-Simply aim the cannon by left-clicking your mouse near the mouth, or by pressing 'a' or 'd' buttons to move it up and down respectively.
-To pan use mouse- right click or ( <-- and --> ) arrow keys
-To zoom use (Up and Down ) arrow keys or scroll bar of your mouse!
-To increase speed of ball press 'f' or to decrease it press 's'
-To fire, press space bar

Radius of bomb increases with each attempt and you have 3 attempts to get max points!s
